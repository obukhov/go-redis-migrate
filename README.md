# go-redis-migrate

Script to copy data by keys pattern from one redis instance to another.

["Copy 1 Million Redis Keys in 2 Minutes with Golang" blog post](https://blog.dclg.net/copy-1-million-redis-keys-in-2-minutes-with-golang)

### Usage

```bash
go-redis-migrate copy <source> <destination> --pattern="prefix:*"
```

*Source*, *destination* - can be provided as just `<host>:<port>` or in Redis URL format: `redis://[:<password>@]<host>:<port>[/<dbIndex>]` 
*Pattern* - can be glob-style pattern supported by [Redis SCAN](https://redis.io/commands/scan) command.

Other flags:
```bash
  --report int           Report current status every N seconds (default 1)
  --scanCount int        COUNT parameter for redis SCAN command (default 100)
  --exportRoutines int   Number of parallel export goroutines (default 30)
  --pushRoutines int     Number of parallel push goroutines (default 30)
```

### Installation

Download the binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/obukhov/go-redis-migrate/releases).

### General idea

There are 3 main stages of copying keys:
1. Scanning keys in source
2. Dumping values and TTLs from source
3. Restoring values and TTLs in destination

Scanning is performed with a single goroutine, scanned keys are sent to keys channel (type is chan string). From keys 
channel N export goroutines are consuming keys and perform `DUMP` and `PTTL` for them as a pipeline command. Results
are combined in KeyDump structure and transferred to channel of this type. Another M push goroutines are consuming from 
the channel and perform `RESTORE` command on the destination instance.

To guarantee that all keys are exported and restored `sync.WaitingGroup` is used. To monitor current status there is a
separate goroutine that outputs value of atomic counters (for each stage) every K seconds. 

### Performance tests

Performed on a laptop with redis instances, running in docker.

#### Test #1
Source database: 453967 keys.
Keys to copy:     10000 keys.
